# 👋 Hey, I’m Jack.

Front-end engineer. Design systems nerd.  San Franciscan. Currently building Angular dashboards and UI component libraries at Cisco. Former data engineer at Neo4j London, where I accidentally got 3 million TikTok views explaining graph theory. Whoops.

<!-- I build sleek, accessible user interfaces that make devs and designers breathe easier. If you're into scalable components, clean layouts, and some spicy Tailwind, we’re gonna get along.

## 🛠 What I Actually Do

- Build reusable UI components in **Angular**, **React**, and **Storybook**
- Refactor confusing front-end messes into clean, scalable systems
- Design beautiful, responsive UIs (bonus points if I get to delete CSS)
- Translate Figma into real life with pixel-perfect execution
- Tell the difference between a good tooltip and a war crime -->

## 🧪 Stuff I’ve Built Lately

- 📚 [Storybook Component Library](https://slooops.github.io/asdf/storybook-static/)  
  20+ custom components. Cards. Dropdowns. Modals. Tables. Can tell the difference between a good tooltip and a war crime.

- ⚙️ Internal Dashboards @ Cisco  
  Built Angular dashboards that connect to secure Oracle DBs, upgraded the app several Angular version numbers, run regression models, and don’t crash (usually).

- ✨ UI Redesign  
  Replaced an ancient UI with something that doesn’t make your eyes bleed. Bonus: removed security vulnerabilities along the way.

- 🤓 [Wordle clone](https://wordle.jaxks.co)  
  Because I’m fun like that.
